<h1>Supply Chain Data Exchange Standard (SC DEX) </h1>

<h2>About SC DEX</h2>
<p>The Supply Chain Data Exchange Standard is a global and open data exchange standard designed to be in compliance with new due diligence directives such as the CSDDD, CSDR, and HRDD. The exchange standard is meant to ensure that reporting of and research on supply chains data remains accessible and non-duplicative for both civil society organizations, corporations, policy implementors and auditors, and suppliers alike.</p>

<h2>Key Features</h2>
<p>There are three main features that the supply chain data exchange standard aims to do. 1) set a core data exchange standard with enough minimum viable data identifiers for identifying a production facility and its relationship to other production facilities or organizations in the exchange 2) enable bridging to extensions custom built for organizations, sectors, or use cases and 3) create a foundational layer for eventual data exchange based on the standard.</p>

<p>By design, the core data schema of the SC DEX is minimal, as this allows for data contributions from all stakeholders, including small production facilities that may be located in areas of low-connectivity or accessing the data exchange through mobile devices. Extensions are intended to be custom built and share enough data identifiers with the core data schema to enable easy bridging. The core data schema will always be kept openly accessible and governed by all contributors of the data exchange standard, while extensions can be created and maintained by anyone.</p>
