If you're interested in creating an extension for a new use case, you've come to the right place! Here are the steps for creating a new extension. 

1. Take a look at the examples folder to familiarize yourself with what typical extensions and use cases look like.
2. Go to the [TEMPLATE LINK] to fill in the use case description and the fields that are typically in and extension
3. Submit the template for comment. While you're welcome to use the extension yourself or internally however and whenever you'd like, the official extensions in this repository go through a review process in order to help maintain quality and consistency in how extensions are used.
4. Extensions will be reviewed for duplication and completeness and approved on a bi-weekly basis. Comments will be left on extensions that are missing components or are similar to existing extensions and might be better as a merge or iteration of an existing use case.
